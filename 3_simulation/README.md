# Stage 3: Simulation experiments with amino acid mutations

Folder naming: Mutating the amino acid X at place yyyy to Z: XyyyyZ.\
Can be more than one amino acid replaced.\
WT: wild type.

The equalization simulations are 2500000 steps (5 ns). The full simulation dcd file is not include due to its size.

We use RMSD and number/distance of hydrogen bonding to measure the how well the moleculars are connected.
